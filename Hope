Over the sees an abpve the skies, stars shine brighter than you no matter what,
Love is a star and it's never coming down but runs shouting across the sky at night,
Shoot me down, I'm pleading now and I'll be down on you,
I dream of paradiseverytime I close my eyes,
And if you have no plans tonight, I am on it,
Know that I won't leave you out,
I never had much faith in miracles of love, 
But there's no-one on earth I'd rathter be with,
Because you won't let me down,
Now I want to put my heart on the line,
Because everytime we spend the night, your sex takes me to paradise,
You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long,
Can I just stay here and spend a lifetime of days?
I can lift you up, show you and take you to places we wanna be,
Like the legends, our ends were beginning,
We've got to devour and give ourselves up,
Let's raise our glasses to the sky,
Because stars give us love that we humans can't give ourselves,
Look at them!!!
Look how they shine for you and everything you do!
Ooo...
It must be love...
